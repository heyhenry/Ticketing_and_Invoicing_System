# Ticketing_and_Invoicing_System

This is an assignment coordinated by RMIT for a java programming unit I took a year ago. This is my attempt from 
scratch to facilitate programming skills and knowledge after undergoing beginning self-learning of the Java language 
this winter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>This program will specifically simulate the data recording and monthly invoicing procedures for a customer
using the Regional Passenger Train Service in a simple console-drive application on a proof-of-concept level.</p>

<p>Passengers using this Regional Passenger Train Service will have a customer account linked to a credit card and
the passenger is issed with an electronic ticket / pass associated with that account, which can be used to not
only travel on the Regional Passenger Train Service, but also purchase items from the onboard kiosk whilst travelling
on a train.</p> 

**Disclaimer:** <p>*I have written the code following the strict guidelines instructed in the assignment brief. The only difference 
is my own validation checks and regexes I have implemented for my own personal benefit of becoming familiar with the concept.*</p>
